All that glitters is not gold
Fair is foul, and foul is fair: Hover through the fog and filthy air.
These violent delights have violent ends...
By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes. Open, locks, Whoever knocks!
Hell is empty and all the devils are here.
Brevity is the soul of wit.
If music be the food of love, play on.
Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow, That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
Now is the winter of our discontent.
