    "We will be solving 50 integrals using techniques from calculus 2. We will use the Sympy library to verify our answers. The integrals are from the following [video](https://youtu.be/XOUwIdufY9Y) by the Youtube channel blackpenredpen. There is also a pdf file attached containing the 50 integrals as well as some formulas useful for solving them. All of these will be indefinite integrals and we will utilise pretty standard notation. For some function $f(x)$, we will convey the indefinite integral as equal to the function $F(x)$. This will be written as the final answer for each integral to make it clearer to read."

We may end up with a regular integral which may be easily solved, but usually we would have a trig integral. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the important trig identities needed to solve many trig integrals. After evaluating the integral in terms of $\\theta$, we would have to convert back to $x$. You can do this rahter easily by using the inverse version of the trig function you used to sub. To simplify, you would use some facts about the definitions of the trig functions to get rid of the inverse ones in your solution if possible. Drawing a triangle to do this on paper might be useful as it usually involves figuring out the sides of a right-angled triangle whose angle is represented by the inverse trig function.\n",

Sometimes, you might have a quadratic that is not in the desired form. In such cases, it might be useful to complete the square to get something that resembles one of hte three forms above. The hardest part about trig sub might be solving the trig integral after substitutions and simplifications have taken place."

We might have a difficult looking integral that can be made quite a bit simpler by decomposing the fraction. Afterwards, we may use a bit of substitutions and natural logarithms to solve the integral. You will have to be able to do partial fraction decomposition and polynomial long division for this section. While we will not cover explicity how to decompose a rational expression, I will give some useful formulae. An example with linear factors:\n",
