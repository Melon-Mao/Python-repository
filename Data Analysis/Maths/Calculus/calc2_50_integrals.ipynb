    "We will be solving 50 integrals using techniques from calculus 2. We will use the Sympy library to verify our answers. The integrals are from the following [video](https://youtu.be/XOUwIdufY9Y) by the Youtube channel blackpenredpen. There is also a pdf file attached containing the 50 integrals as well as some formulas useful for solving them. All of these will be indefinite integrals and we will utilise pretty standard notation. For some function $f(x)$, we will convey the indefinite integral as equal to the function $F(x)$. This will be written as the final answer for each integral to make it clearer to read."
