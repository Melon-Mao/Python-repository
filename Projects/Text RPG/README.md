# Text RPG

This is a text-based RPG game that I made in Python. It is a work in progress, and I will be adding more features to it as I go along. The purpose of this mainly is to improve my skills on Python, and to have fun with it.

## How to play
This is a text-based game, so you will need to type in commands to play. The possible commands that can be written are usually given in the game. They are normally numbers that correspond with actions. The controls for this game are really quite simple.

## How to run
To run this game, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. If you do not have Python installed, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once you have Python installed, you can run the game by opening the `main.py` file in the `Text RPG` folder. You can do this by opening the folder in your file explorer, and double-clicking on the `main.py` file. You can also run the game by opening the `main.py` file in IDLE (or other code editor / IDE that supports it), and pressing F5. 

I am planning on making a .exe file for this game, but I am not sure when I will get around to it. I will update this README.md file when I do.
