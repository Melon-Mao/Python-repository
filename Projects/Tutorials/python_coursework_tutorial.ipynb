    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must look at the brief and see what the most important things are. It is good practice to create some sort of main function that all the code will run off. At the end, we would like to have only one piece of code outside of functions that run, and that will just be calling our main function like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to let the customer choose between 3 and 6 different flavours for their own tin, and it has to be exactly one kilogram. They can only add in increments of 100g. All this information is important, but the first bullet point states to enter and store the details of the customer. We want our program to be modular i.e. it is seperated into different functions that do different things. First we will create a function to store the users details."

    "## Storing the Customer's Details\n",
    "\n",
    "To store customers details in a way that carries over even if we restart the program, we want to store it in a file. We can do this in a few ways. Firstly, we want to choose the type of file we have. Remember, we are also asked to store the details of the customers order, which we will handle later. To be prepared for that, we will use a .csv file, as they are used to store multiple pieces of information on a single line, seperated by a delimiter, usually a comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first lets create a function to get the customers details. Just their name is sufficient. If you just want the basics, you can skip a bit of this section, which is about making sure the name is valid and making it look good.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_customer_details():\n",
    "    name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We cam make it look nice with .title(). This will capitalise the first letter of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"jim bob\".title())\n",
    "```\n",
    "This prints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Jim Bob\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing we can do is make sure the name entered is not invalid. For example, we should not allow a user to have any numbers or special characters in their name. We can do this with the .isaplha() method. This will return True if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at least one character. Otherwise it will return False. When using this with names, we might want to get rid of any spaces since the method does not see them as 'alphabetic' and would return False for a name like 'Jim Bob' which is otherwise valid. We can solve this with .replace(), which takes two arguments. The first is a string it will look for inside the string you use it on. The second is the string it will replace the first string with. So what we want to do is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "            customer_name = input(\"Please enter your name: \").title()\n",
    "            sleep(1)\n",
    "            if (customer_name.replace(\" \", \"\")).isalpha() == False:\n",
    "                print(\"Please enter a valid name.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that we have replaced every space in the string with nothing, and then checked if the string is alphabetic. If it is not, we print an error message and ask the user to enter their name again. To do that, we will use while loops and try-except blocks. You should have this in your code as data validation and authentication is required for this coursework. These validation methods work like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    valid = False\n",
    "    while valid == False\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            \"the code you want to try, usually an input from the user\"\n",
    "            valid = True # If there's no errors, it will reach this and the loop ends\n",
    "        except Exception:  # Any error you suspect might occur\n",
    "            \"the code you want to run if there is an error\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The way this works is it will run everything inside the loop until there is no errors. If there are any errors, it will be caught by the except statement, that bit of code runs and the loop goes on. If there aren't any errors however, the except won't run and the code will reach the end of the try statement. We want to have a line of code assigning valid to True. Since the code only runs if valid is False, the loop ends and the program continues. ALso, you can have multiple except statements to catch multiple different errors and run different things for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if the user enters a bit of code that doesn't directly create an error but will do so a few lines down or will mess something else up? We can prevent the user from inputting anything else that we don't want using if statements along with the raise keyword. If the if statement returns true, say the user enters a negative number or a number out of range, then it will raise an error. You want this to be an error that you can catch with the except statement. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        number = int(input(\"Please enter a number between 0 and 10: \"))\n",
    "        if number < 0 or number > 10:\n",
    "            raise ValueError\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        print(\"Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here entering a number such as 11 wouldn't normally create an error, but we can use the raise keyword to make it do so. This is useful for data validation. In the space below, try entering an invalid option and see what happens."

    "Now that you got their name, you have to store it. We can do this using open(). One good practice to have it to open files with the 'with' keyword. This will automatically close the file when you are done with it. You can also use the 'as' keyword to assign the file to a variable. This is useful because you can use the variable to access the file. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    with open(\"file.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "        file.write(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we use .write() on the file to write the users name to it. Also, you could store the order number of the user by finding the amount of lines in the file and adding one for the current user. This would look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    with open(\"file.txt\", \"r+\") as file:\n",
    "        customer_details = file.readlines()\n",
    "        total_customers = len(customer_details)\n",
    "        details_to_add = {total_customers + 1: customer_name}\n",
    "        file.write(f\"{str(details_to_add)} \\n\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What we are doing is opening the file in r+ mode, meaning that we can read and write to the file. Then we use readlines() to put all the lines of the file into a list. We can easily find the amount of lines this way using len(). Then, I created a dictionary with the key being the total amount lines, representing customer orders + 1 (since this is for the current order which hasn't been written to the file yet) and the value is the name of the customer. We then write to the file, converting the dictionary to a string because you can only write strings to a file. We should also add \\n, representing a new line so the next customer's details will be on the next line. Here, you can see the use of a f-string, which allow you to use variables inside strings which is really useful. However, I believe that the version of Python that will be used for the coursework is around 3.4 which does not support f-strings. You will have to use a work around such as using +, or , or .format()."

    "## Viewing the flavours\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is not explictly stated as a requirement for the coursework, it is a very nice and practically essential feature to have. To do this, first we must have a collection storing the flavours. We have 4 built-in data collections to choose from: list, tuple, dictionary and set. We will be using a dictionary due to its very useful feature of having key-value pairs. Create a dictionary containing the flavours as the values and have the key be a number. For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "    flavours = {\n",
    "    1: \"Caramel Twist\",\n",
    "    2: \"Orange Crush\",\n",
    "    3: \"Chocolate Bar\",\n",
    "    4: \"Brazil Nut in Chocolate\",\n",
    "    5: \"Cornish Fudge\",\n",
    "    6: \"Strawberry Treat\",\n",
    "    7: \"Orange Smoothie\",\n",
    "    8: \"Toffee Bar\",\n",
    "    9: \"Hazelnut Triangle\",\n",
    "    10: \"Coconut Dream\",\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We should define a new function that lets the user view the flavours. We will let the user call this function through an input in the main function. The view flavour function can be really simple, just printing out the dictionary as is. If we want to make it look a little nicer, we can do a for loop printing out each flavour and their number. This will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def view_flavours():\n",
    "        for key, value in flavours.items():\n",
    "            print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def view_flavours():\n",
    "        for key in flavours:\n",
    "            print(f\"{key}: {flavours[key]}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After that they should return to the main function. If you aren't sure how to set that up, have a user input with some given options. These should be a number representing an option to make it simpler and less likely to make errors on the users side. If none of the valid options are pressed, we should restart the main function. We can have a while loop and try except blocks to validate the input, but if the main function only has a single main if statement, then we cna do something simpler. If none of the if or elif statement runs, then have an else statement to call the main function again. This will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if user_input == 1:\n",
    "        \"the code for the first option\"\n",
    "    elif user_input == 2:\n",
    "        \"the code for the second option\"\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        main()\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Choosing tin\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the user should be able to choose their tin of chocolate. As per usual, we should have this in a seperate function and call it from the main function. Continuing with our use of dictionaries, we can use them to create a customers order. First, we want them to choose a flavour. If all the flavours in your dictionary are capitalised, then we can use .title() for the user input to prevent it from being case specific. You can make the choice of flavour simple or a bit more complicated. You could just have the user be able to choose a flavour by entering its name or the number associated with it or you could let them do either. If you choose the latter, then you will need two ways that the user could reach valid = True to end the loop. Before we do this, we should create an empty dictionary to store the users order. This will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    order = {}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "After confirming that their input is valid, we let them choose an amount. Since the coursework asks for the customer to be able to enter the amount in increments of 100, we can just let them choose an amount and make sure if it is divisible by 100 to achieve the same affect. We also want to make sure that they do not have more than 500 for one flavour, so we give them a possible range of values with the inequality 100 <= amount <= 500. The available options are 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500. This will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "If it is not in that range, we raise a ValueError and they have to enter the amount again. Also, the coursework says that the tin has to add up to 1000g. To do this, will put the choosing flavour and amount part inside a while loop that will run until the total amount of the order is 1000g. We can do this like this:\n",

    "        # The code for choosing flavour and amount\n",

    "```python\n",
    "    order[flavour] = amount_to_add\n",

    "    order.update({flavour: amount_to_add})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these do the same thing so you can choose whichever you prefer. That should only run after the program makes sure that both the flavour and amount are valid. To make sure that the current amount of the order doesn't make the total go above 1000g, we can do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if sum(order.values()) + amount_to_add > 1000:\n",
    "        print(\"You have exceeded the maximum amount of chocolate you can have in your tin.\")\n",

One more thing to validate is that the coursework asks for the user to enter between 3 and 6 flavours. We can do this by checking if the length of the order dictionary is between 3 and 6. This will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if not 3 <= len(order) <= 6:\n",
