    "## 1. Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several in-depth data types that are used to do different things as well as represent different kind of values. This tutorial will only cover the the basic data types that you have to know to get started with Python. These are numbers (ints, floats), strings and booleans. There are a few other data types that will be covered in this tutorial along with the other topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of numbers in Python: ints and floats. Ints or integers are whole numbers and floats are numbers with a decimal point. You can do basic calculations with these numbers by themselves or assigning them to variables. Below you can see that we have assigned the number 1 to the variable 'x'. We have also given two examples of floats. You can see that there is a decimal point seperating the number. Floats may represent whole numbers (e.g. 1.0), as long as there is a decimal point. Both floats and ints can be positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "    x = 1 # int\n",
    "    x = -5 # int\n",
    "    y = 1.0 # float\n",
    "    z = -414.7 # float\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are a sequence of characters. It can be anything inside two quotation marks. You can use single or double quotes to represent a string, it does not matter. Strings are quite simple are used to output text. You can also use triple quotes to represent a string which is useful if you want it to span multiple lines. Below are some examples of strings. On the first one, the words 'Hello World' are inside single quotes. The first and second example are equiavalent. On the third example, everything between the two triple quotes count as one string.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "    x = 'Hello World' # string\n",
    "    y = \"Hello World\" # string with double quotes, which I will use for the rest of the tutorial\n",
    "    z = \"\"\"\n",
    "    Hello,\n",
    "    I like\n",
    "    turtles.\n",
    "    \"\"\" # multi-line string\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "Booleans are a data type that can only be True or False. They represent logical values and can be used in conditional statements i.e. to check if something is true or false. You can also think of True as being 1 and False as being 0. Below are two examples of booleans. Make sure that you capitalise the first letter of True and False.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "    x = True # boolean\n",
    "    y = False # boolean\n",

    "## 2. Output\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Using print()\n",
    "\n",
    "Output is the process of displaying information to the user. This is a very important part of Python and is used in practically all programs. The main way of outputting data is by using the print() function (more on functions later). The print() function takes in a string or a variable (will talk about this in a bit), and outputs it to the user through a terminal / console. Below are some examples of outputting or printing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello World\") # prints the words 'Hello World'\n",
    "    print(x) # prints the value of x, a variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Outputting multiple values\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to output multiple things in Python. First, you could just use multiple print() functions. This is the most basic way of doing it. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\")\n",
    "    print(\"World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hello\n",
    "    World\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem with this is that the two strings are on different lines, which you may not want. There are ways of changing this but that is outside of the scope of this tutorial. A second way of outputting multiple things is with the + operator. This can be used to add or concatenate (just the technical name) two strings together. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\" + \"World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    HelloWorld\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem you can see here is that there is no space between the two words. This is because the + operator does not add spaces between strings. A solution is to have a string with just a single space added in between the two words. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\" + \" \" + \"World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hello World\n",
    "\n",
    "That seems annoying to do, especially if you have a lot of strings to add together. A easier way way of doing the same thing is to using a comma. This is the way I prefer to do it. Below is an example of this which returns the same output as the code above.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\", \"World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Using f-strings\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a way of outputting multiple things that is a bit more advanced. This is called an f-string. This is a string that has a variable or expression inside it. This is useful if you want to output a string with a variable in it. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    x = 5\n",
    "    print(f\"The value of x is {x}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The value of x is 5\n",
    "\n",
    "You put the variable inside curly brackets and then put an f in front of the string. This is a bit more advanced and you do not need to know this to get started with Python. You can also use expressions inside the curly brackets. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    x = 5\n",
    "    y = 10\n",
    "    print(f\"The sum of x and y is {x + y}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Try using the interactive code cells below to print somethings out. You can also try printing out multiple things at once."

    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Assigning variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are used to store data. You can then use this data later on in the program without having to type it all out. Variables are very useful and I cannot think of any program I've written or see that does not use them. Variables are assigned a value using the = operator. Another thing to note is that they are assigned the data type of the value you assign them to. Below are some examples of variables.\n",

    "    z = \"Hello World\" # string\n",
    "    a = True # boolean\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Accessing variables\n",
    "\n",
    "To access variables, you can output them with print(). Just put the variable name inside the brackets. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    x = 1\n",
    "    print(x) # prints 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to have a variable be alongside something else in print(). You could do this with the + operater or a comma. You have to make sure when using + because if the two things are not the same data type or are a data type that can't be added, you will get an error. This won't happen with a comma. Below are some examples of accessing variables with print().\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    x = 1\n",
    "    y = 2\n",
    "    print(x + y) # prints 3\n",
    "    print(x, y) # prints 1 2\n",
    "    name = \"Bob\"\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\", name) # prints Hello Bob\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\" + name) # prints HelloBob\n",
    "    print (\"Hello\" + 5) # Returns TypeError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Naming variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You can name your variables most things. Some things which you can't do are:\n",
    "* Name a variable the same as a keyword (e.g. if, while, for)\n",
    "* Name a variable the same as a data type (e.g. int, float, string)\n",
    "* Name a variable the same as a function (e.g. print, input)\n",
    "* Start a variable name with a number\n",
    "* Use spaces in a variable name\n",
    "* Use special symbols in a variable name (e.g. !, @, #)\n",
    "* Use underscores at the start of a variable name (e.g. _x). You can use them in the middle or end of a variable name (e.g. x_, x_y, x_y_z)\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of valid and invalid variable names are below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1 # valid\n",
    "134 = 1 # invalid\n",
    "x_ = 1 # valid\n",
    "_x = 1 # invalid\n",
    "x y = 1 # invalid\n",
    "x-y = 1 # invalid\n",
    "dhaduafvaf = 1 # valid\n",
    "*&$^%$^%$^% = 1 # invalid\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 4.1 Using input()\n",
    "\n",
    "Input is the process of getting information from the user. This is also a very important part of Python, just like outputting data. The main way of getting input from the user is by using the input() function which is really simple. The input() function takes in some data which can be assigned to some variable and then used later on in the program. You can also put a string inside the brackets of the input() function to act as a prompt that is displayed to the user when they can enter an input. Below is an example of inputting data (You can also see we are using everything we have learnt so far as they are core parts of Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    name = input(\"What is your name? \")\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\", name)\n",

    "```python\n",
    "    name = input(\"What is your name? \")\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, your name is\", name)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Converting data types\n",
    "\n",
    "If anything is inputed into the input() function, then the default result is a string representing their answer. This means that if you want to use the inputted data as a number, you have to convert it to an int or float. This is done by using the int() or float() functions. When you assign the inputted data to a variable, you can put the input() inside the brackets of the int() or float() function. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    x = int(input(\"Age: \"))\n",

    "    print(int(y) + 1) # This works\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen above, you can convert the variable to a different data type while you are about to use it, such as printing it. This is useful if you want to use the inputted data as a number but don't want to assign it to a specific data type. Also, you could choose to print out the input statement without assigning it to a variable. There is an example of this below.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "        print(int(input(\"Age: \")) + 1)\n",

    "## 6. Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many operators in Python that can be used for a variety of things. For example, you may want to add the values of two variables together. You may also want to check if two variables are equal to each other, or if one variable is greater than another. Different operators will let you do all of these, assign the answer to some variable and output it if you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Arithmetic operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numbers. The built-in arithmetic operators in Python are really quite basic, meaning taht you should know most of them. Below is a list of the arithmetic operators in Python.\n",
    "* '+' - addition\n",
    "* '-' - subtraction\n",
    "* '*' - multiplication\n",
    "* '/' - division\n",
    "* '%' - modulus\n",
    "* '**' - exponentiation\n",
    "* '//' - floor division\n",
    "\n",
    "You should recognise all but perhaps the modulus and floor division operators. The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of two numbers. The floor division operator returns the quotient (whole part) of the division of two numbers, rounded down to the nearest integer. Below are some examples of these operators in use.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "        print(5 + 2) # 7\n",
    "        print(5 - 2) # 3\n",
    "        print(5 * 2) # 10\n",

    "        print(5 % 2) # 1\n",
    "        print(5 ** 2) # 25\n",
    "        print(5 // 2) # 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that may be important to note is the order of operations. This is the order in which the operators are evaluated. The order of operations in Python is:\n",
    "* Exponentiation\n",
    "* Multiplication\n",
    "* Division\n",
    "* Addition\n",
    "* Subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if you have an expression like 5 + 2 * 3, the answer will be 11, not 15. This is because the multiplication and division operators are evaluated before the addition and subtraction operators. If you want to change the order of operations, you can use brackets / parentheses. Also, multiplication and division operators are at the same level so if you have an expression like 5 * 2 / 3, the answer will be 3.3 recurring, not 3.5 as it is evaluated from left to right. The same goes for addition and subtraction. If you have an expression like 5 + 2 - 3, the answer will be 4, not 6. Below are some examples of this.\n",

    "### 6.2 Comparison operators\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, these operators are used to compare two values, saying if one is greater than another, or if they are equal to each other and returning a boolean value. The built-in comparison operators in Python are really quite basic, as you should understand them even if you haven't seen them before or the syntax is not what you are used to. The built-in comparison operators in Python are:\n",
    "* '==' - equal to\n",
    "* '!=' - not equal to\n",
    "* '>' - greater than\n",
    "* '<' - less than\n",
    "* '>=' - greater than or equal to\n",

    "### 6.3 Logical operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators can be used to combine multiple statements with comparison operators. These are also very basic and recognisable. The built-in logical operators in Python are:\n",
    "* 'and' - returns True if both statements are True\n",
    "* 'or' - returns True if one of the statements is True\n",
    "* 'not' - returns the opposite of the statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The order they are evaluated in is 'not' first, then 'and' and lastly 'or' but you can decide the order by making use of brackets. Below are some examples of these operators in use.\n",

    "\n",
    "Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. All of these besides '=' are shorthand for their respective operater plus assigning the result to the variable on the left-hand side of the '=' symbol (e.g. x += 5 is really just x = x + 5) The built-in assignment operators in Python are:\n",
    "* '=' - assigns a value to a variable\n",

    "## 8. Data collections\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are 4 built-in data collections: lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries. These are used to store multiple values in one variable, which can be really useful in programs for sorting or storing large amounts of data. We will go through each of these data collections in appropriate detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1 Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are used to store multiple values in one variable. They are probably the most commonly used data collection in Python and are very useful. Lists are created using square brackets, '[]', and each value is separated by a comma. Some important properties of lists are the fact that they are ordered, changeable and allow duplicate values. Lists can have values of any data type and even of multiple data types. Below is an example of a list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "        x = [\"apple\", \"banana\", 4, 5.5, True]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This list has 3 values, \"apple\", \"banana\" and \"cherry\". You can access the values in a list by using the index of the value, which is the position of the value in the list. The first value in a list has the index 0, the second value has the index 1 and so on. Make sure you remember that the index starts at 0, so the index at any point is one less than the position. Below is an example of accessing the values in a list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "        x = [\"apple\", \"banana\", 3895285840]\n",
    "        print(x[0]) # apple\n",
    "        print(x[1]) # banana\n",
    "        print(x[2]) # 3895285840\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many things you with a list and ways to access the contents that are beyond the scope of this tutorial. You can find more information about lists with some online recoures or even the official Python documentation, which can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html). Some of the things you can do with lists are:\n",
    "* Change the value of a specific index\n",
    "* Add a value to the end of the list\n",
    "* Remove a value from the list\n",
    "* Sort the list\n",
    "* Reverse the list\n",
    "* Copy the list\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also find the amount of values stored in a list with the len() function (this can be used to find the length of many other things like other collections and even the length of strings). To add a value to the end of the list, you can use the append() method. Below is an example of using the append() method.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "        x = [\"apple\", \"banana\", 3895285840]\n",
    "        x.append(\"cherry\")\n",
    "        print(x) # [\"apple\", \"banana\", 3895285840, \"cherry\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove a value from the list, you can use the remove() method. Below is an example of using the remove() method.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "        x = [\"apple\", \"banana\", 3895285840]\n",

    "        print(x) # [\"apple\", 3895285840]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other methods you can use with lists are:\n",
    "* clear() - removes all the elements from the list\n",
    "* copy() - returns a copy of the list\n",
    "* count() - returns the number of elements with the specified value\n",
    "* extend() - adds the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list\n",
    "* index() - returns the index of the first element with the specified value\n",
    "* insert() - adds an element at the specified position\n",
    "* pop() - removes the element at the specified position\n",
    "* reverse() - reverses the order of the list\n",
    "* sort() - sorts the list\n",
    "\n",
    "One other thing you can do with lists and all other data collections is nest them inside each other. This means that you can have a list inside a list, a list inside a tuple, a tuple inside a list and so on. Below is an example of a list inside a list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "        x = [\"apple\", \"banana\", 3895285840, [\"cherry\", \"orange\"]]\n",
    "        print(x[3]) # [\"cherry\", \"orange\"]\n",
    "        print(x[3][0]) # cherry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2 Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are very similar to lists, but they are immutable, which means that they cannot be changed. Tuples are created using round brackets, '()', and each value is separated by a comma. Below is an example of a tuple.\n",
    "    \n",

    "```python\n",
    "        x = (\"apple\", \"banana\", 4, 5.5, True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, even if you omit the round brackets, the tuple will still be created. Below is an example of a tuple without round brackets. As tuples are ordered, you can access the values in a tuple by using the index of the value, which is the position of the value in the tuple. This works exactly like lists. One thing you cannot do with a tuple is change the value of a specific index, or add or remove values from the tuple. However, you can get around this by converting to a list with the list() function, changing the value, and then converting back to a tuple with the tuple() function. Below is an example of changing the value of a specific index in a tuple.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "        x = (\"apple\", \"banana\", 4, 5.5, True)\n",
    "        x = list(x)\n",
    "        x[0] = \"cherry\"\n",
    "        x = tuple(x)\n",
    "        print(x) # (\"cherry\", \"banana\", 4, 5.5, True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some methods you can use with tuples are:\n",
    "* count() - returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple\n",
    "* index() - searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found\n",
    "* len() - returns the length of the tuple\n",
    "* max() - returns the largest element in the tuple\n",
    "* min() - returns the smallest element in the tuple\n",
    "* sum() - returns the sum of all elements in the tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.3 Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are used to store multiple values in one variable, but they are unordered and unindexed. Sets are created using curly brackets, '{}', and each value is separated by a comma. Below is an example of a set.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "        x = {\"apple\", \"banana\", 4, 5.5, True}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you cannot have an empty set by just using '{}', as this will create an empty dictionary. You can create an empty set by using the set() function. Methods you can use with sets are:\n",
    "* add() - adds an element to the set\n",
    "* clear() - removes all the elements from the set\n",
    "* copy() - returns a copy of the set\n",
    "* discard() - remove the specified item\n",
    "* isdisjoint() - returns whether two sets have a intersection or not\n",
    "* issubset() - returns whether another set contains this set or not\n",
    "* issuperset() - returns whether this set contains another set or not\n",
    "* remove() - removes the specified element\n",
    "* union() - return a set containing the union of sets\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.4 Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. Dictionaries are created using curly brackets, '{}', and each key:value pair is separated by a comma. Below is an example of a dictionary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "        x = {\"name\" : \"John\", \"age\" : 36}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets. Below is an example of accessing the items of a dictionary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "        x = {\"name\" : \"John\", \"age\" : 36}\n",
    "        print(x[\"name\"]) # John\n",
    "        print(x[\"age\"]) # 36\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To add an item to the dictionary, you can use the same syntax as accessing the items. Below is an example of adding an item to the dictionary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "        x = {\"name\" : \"John\", \"age\" : 36}\n",
    "        x[\"country\"] = \"Norway\"\n",
    "        print(x) # {\"name\" : \"John\", \"age\" : 36, \"country\" : \"Norway\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some methods you can use with dictionaries are:\n",
    "* clear() - removes all the elements from the dictionary\n",
    "* copy() - returns a copy of the dictionary\n",
    "* get() - returns the value of the specified key\n",
    "* items() - returns a list containing a tuple for each key value pair\n",
    "* keys() - returns a list containing the dictionary's keys\n",
    "* pop() - removes the element with the specified key\n",
    "* update() - updates the dictionary with the specified key-value pairs\n",
    "* values() - returns a list of all the values in the dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There are other methods that can be used with all of these collections. You can get a full list by visiting the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html).\n",
    "Note: All of the collections can be created using the constructor of the collection. For example, you can create a list using the list() constructor. Below is an example of creating a list using the list() constructor.\n",
    "    \n",

    "        print(x) # [\"apple\", \"True\", 3895285840]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to use these data collections appropriately as it can affect the efficiency and effectiveness of you code. For example, if you need to store a list of values that will not change, you should use a tuple instead of a list, as tuples are immutable and therefore more efficient. If you need to store a list of values that will change, you should use a list instead of a tuple, as lists are mutable. If you need to store a list of values that are unique, you should use a set instead of a list, which are also faster at adding at removing items due to their nature of being unordered. If you have a list of values that you need to access by a key, you should use a dictionary instead of a list, as dictionaries are faster at accessing items by key. Below is a table that shows the differences between the collections.\n",
    "\n",

Below is an example of the slice operator. The syntax for the slice operator is [start:end:step]. The start is the index of the first item you want to include in the slice. The end is the index of the first item you want to exclude from the slice. The step is the number of items you want to skip between each item in the slice. If you do not specify a start, the slice will start at the beginning of the collection. If you do not specify an end, the slice will end at the end of the collection. If you do not specify a step, the slice will include every item in the range. Below is an example of the slice operator.\n",

    "            # code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pass data, known as parameters or arguments, into a function. Below is an example of a function with parameters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
